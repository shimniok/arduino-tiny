6/10/2015:

* Fix bootloader tiny1634 maximum size spec.

* Go full 1.6.x, now you can just sync github to hardware in sketchbook and modify avrdude.conf. 1.0.6 setup is documented.
* Add Tiny1634 support (based on rambo's core)

4/1/2015:

3/15/2015:
* Update boards.txt - there are now two entries for the optiboot boards as a hopefully temporary solution to changes in how bootloader .hex file location is specified. For non-optiboot, it doesn't matter, since 1.0.6 would just fail to write the flash which we're not writing anyway.
* Update pins_arduino.h to define SPI pins.
* Remove bogus programmer entries from boards.txt

3/14/2015:
* Optiboot works.
